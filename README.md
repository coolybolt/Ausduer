3d printer design intended as a learning experaince in kinematics and motion control systems with the added benefit of 3d printer that can overtake overhangs

The Idea behind this project is to ground up go over industruial quality 3d printer workflow and attampt to design multiple 3d printer systems with a end goal of a 4-5 axis 3d printer with Virtual simulation addon.
